###### McDonalds near me is very good and spicy.
   I am living in the  maryville and i am living in the south main street which is near to the U.S Bank and this is a straight line and in this line we are having the theaters and other food plazas like BurgerKing and Tacos which is very near to that one and we are having the gas stations and motels around the corner.There are more good places than **Burger king** in this area particularly in college like  **Chick-fill-A**.
